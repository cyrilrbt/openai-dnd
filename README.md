# dnd-dungeon-master

Using OpenAI ChatGPT and Dall-E, run a D&D game and show pictures of the current scene.
Uses vue & tailwind, initial code generated by ChatGPT.

Keep your developer console open, there is no visual feedback when the app is loading or when an error happens.

The chat API is pretty inconsistent and it's likely that something will break. Reload a couple times. I'm looking for ways to improve my prompts, they're pretty bad right now.
